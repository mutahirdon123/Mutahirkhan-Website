                <h2>Sixgill sharks:</h2>
                <p>
                    Sixgill sharks, belonging to the genus Hexanchus, are deep-sea sharks known for their distinctive appearance, including six gill slits (most sharks have five). They can be found in various ocean depths, often from 200 meters (656 feet) to over 2,000 meters (6,561 feet). These sharks are generally slow-moving and can grow quite large, with some species reaching lengths of up to 4 meters (13 feet). They are believed to be opportunistic feeders, preying on fish, squid, and carrion. Sixgill sharks are often associated with colder, deeper waters, but they are not strictly psychrophiles

             <h2> sperm whale:</h2>
                <p>
                    The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on Earth, known for its distinctive large head and deep diving abilities. They can reach depths of over 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) while hunting for squid and fish. Sperm whales are social animals, often found in pods, and are known for their complex vocalizations, which are thought to play a role in communication and navigation. They are also unique in having a large, waxy substance called spermaceti in their heads, which may help with buoyancy and echolocation.

                <h2> viperfish </h2>
                <p>
                    The viperfish (Chauliodus sloani) is a striking deep-sea fish known for its long, fang-like teeth and large mouth, which make it a formidable predator in the dark depths of the ocean. It can be found at depths of around 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The viperfish has a bioluminescent organ on its body that helps it attract prey in the dark, and it is capable of a unique form of swimming that allows it to move quickly to catch small fish and shrimp. Viperfish have a very low basal metabolic rate, which means they can go for days without food. This adaptation is likely a result of the scarce nature of food in the deep sea.
