 Structural Features:
Hagfish have a long, eel-like body, usually reaching lengths of about 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).
They possess a cartilaginous skull and lack true vertebrae.
Notable for their slime glands, which secrete a mucous substance for defense.
 Bioluminescence: Atlantic hagfish do not exhibit bioluminescence.
 Biofilm: Hagfish may interact with microbial communities in their habitat but do not form biofilms themselves.
 Depth: Found at depths ranging from 100 to 2,000 meters (328 to 6,561 feet) in the North Atlantic Ocean.
 Survival Mechanisms: They are highly adapted to deep-sea conditions, including high pressure and low light. Their ability to produce large amounts of slime helps them evade predators and aids in feeding by engulfing prey.
 Type: Atlantic hagfish are often considered euryhaline, as they can tolerate a range of salinity levels, but they thrive in cold, deep-sea environments.

It is the largest known members of the isopod family, a group of crustaceans closely related to shrimps and crabs. 
It is found in the depth of 2140m.
The enormous size of the giant isopod is a result of a phenomenon known as deep sea gigantism. 
The reason for this size remains a mystery, although some researchers believe it may be an adaptation to help the animal deal with the enormous pressures.
Food is extremely scarce at these great depths, so the isopod has adapted to eat what ever happens to fall from above.This includes bodies of dead whale, squids etc.                                        </p>

It is one of the world’s largest animal and is known to reach a length of up to 60 feet.
They are usually found at the depth of 1175m.
They feed on deep sea fish and others squids.
Giant squid’s body is composed of a mantle, eight arms, and two longer tentacles.
Tentacles contain suction cup which  is surrounded by sharp, serrated edges that help the squid hold on to its prey.
Large eyes are an important adaptation that helps the squid locate food in the darkness of the deep ocean.

The end of the tail is tipped with a light-producing organ known as a photophore. Through a process known as bioluminescence, the photophore glows pink and can give off occasional red flashes.
The large mouth may be an adaptation to allow the eel to eat a wider variety of prey when food is scarce.
It is found at the depth of 1800m.
They feed on small squids.

The angler gets its name from the elongated dorsal spine that supports a light-producing organ known as a photophore. 
Through a chemical process known as bioluminescence, this photophore can produce a blue-green light.
The anglerfish uses its illuminated lure as its hunts for prey. They feed on lanternfish, dragonfish, viperfish, squids, gulper eels and dead organisms.
They have ability to extend both it’s jaw and stomach to an incredible size to store food and use it during scarce of food in deep sea.
They have ability to hide in dark.
They have unusual method of reproduction.The male angler has small hook teeth, which it uses to attach itself to the female.
The two become fused together and their blood vessels join as one. The male will spend the rest of its life joined to the female like a parasite, getting all of his nourishment from her body.
A female can carry up to six males on her body at a time.
They are found at the depth of 1000-2000m.

                <p>
                     As it is the filamentous fungi which helps in to live in extreme environment of ocean world the unique feature is that it can adapt to low temperatures by producing cryoprotectants (substances that protect cells from freezing) or modifying its metabolic pathways to function efficiently in cold environments and also it is osmotolerant so it bears a high pressure  conditions and also produces spore which help it to survive in harsh conditions .it lives in deep sea environment of about below the 1000m depth .                                          </p>
