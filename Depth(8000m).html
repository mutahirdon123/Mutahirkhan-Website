                  It is the specie of archae as it lives in hydrothermal vents ( in 8000m depth) as it thrives in high temperature mostly recognized as hyperthermophiles and also it are of having distinct genetic structures and proteins, which help them maintain function in extreme environments and often forms symbiotic relationships with other extremophiles. The exchange of nutrients with other organisms, such as sulfur-reducing bacteria, supports a mutualistic ecosystem with in the depth of ocean

                <p>
                    Scientific name: Riftia pachyptila
 They are found at the depth of 8000m near the hydrothermal vents.
 They have no mouth and no digestive tract. They depend on bacteria that live inside them for their food. This type of mutually beneficial relationship between two organisms is known as symbiosis. The bacteria actually convert the chemicals from the hydrothermal vents into organic molecules that provide food for the worm.
 These organisms contain Bright red plume. This plume exchange organic compounds with vent environment and provide nutrients to bacteria that live inside them.

                <h2>Clams and crustaceans:</h2>
                <p>
                     They are found at the depth of 8000m near the hydrothermal vents.
 These organisms were getting their food directly from the vents themselves. This process is known as chemosynthesis.
 Hydrothermal vents support unique ecosystems, 
Clams includes:
 Vent clams (Calyptogena gigas) are filter feeders.
Vesicomyid clams (Vesicomya) are symbiotic bacteria-rich.
Crustaceans includes:
 Vent crabs (Bythograea thermydron) are  scavengers.
 Hydrothermal vent shrimp (Rimicaris exoculata) are chemosynthetic.
Vent lobsters (Munidopsis) are opportunistic feeders.
They are adapted to: 
1. Chemosynthesis - symbiotic bacteria convert chemicals to energy
2. Thermal tolerance - survive in hot, chemical-rich environments
3. Symbiotic relationships - mutualistic bacteria provide nutrients
4. Slow metabolism - conserve energy in food-scarce environments
